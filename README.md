# mini-budget-app
Compute your expenses and budget with this mini project app 
I created this project to apply things that i've 
learned in javascript and SASS


### Javascript source file
```html
<script src="js/main.js">
```

### Compiled CSS
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">
```

### Main sass file
Compiled your main.scss everytime you make a changes on your sass file.  
```
scss/main.scss
```
